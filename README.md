eh, why? nothing business, it's just personal

0. i was always able to send my contributions through other means anyway
1. github is a part of a megacorp that is trying to monopolize on open source
2. they are fine working with ICE (and god knows who else)
3. i don't _want_ any of that social crap culture such as stars/followers, reactions and so on to be a part of software development
4. i want to deal with as little of web in my life as possible
5. ego can go fuck itself
